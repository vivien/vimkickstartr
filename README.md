Main ideas
----------

* All your ViM config is in your .vimrc
* Using a plugin should be as easy as adding its name to a file
* No Ruby/whatever language dependency to manage your config
* Pure VimL config (thanks to MarcWeber for VAM!)
* Should be flexible (no headache on configuration)

Why not another "ViM distribution"?
-----------------------------------

There are several other ViM setups, like Janus or spf13-vim, but none
will match your needs exactly (it often includes many plugins you don't
care about). Moreover, having a `~/.vimrc.before`, a `~/.vimrc.after`,
or whatever, in addition to your `~/.vimrc`, sucks a lot.

Installation
------------

The only thing you need is this prepared vimrc. Just copy it in your
`~/.vimrc`.

For the lazy:

    wget https://raw.github.com/v0n/vim-kickstart/master/vimrc -O ~/.vimrc
